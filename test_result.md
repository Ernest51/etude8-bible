However, several issues identified: 1) Character length controls not working properly - generates much more content than token parameter suggests, 2) Single verse formatting has issues, 3) Gemini enrichment not providing longer content as expected, 4) Error handling too permissive.

The app is configured to use https://biblestudy-ai-1.preview.emergentagent.com/api but VERSETS PROG button calls https://etude8-bible-api-production.up.railway.app/api instead.
