The user's reported placeholder text issue was not confirmed - actual content is substantial and properly formatted."

    message: "Backend API testing completed according to review request. Core functionality (health check, basic verse generation, study generation, performance) is working well. However, several issues identified: 1) Character length controls not working properly - generates much more content than token parameter suggests, 2) Single verse formatting has issues, 3) Gemini enrichment not providing longer content as expected, 4) Error handling too permissive. The API is functional for basic use but needs refinement for production quality."

    message: "FRONTEND TESTING COMPLETED - CRITICAL DISPLAY BUG FOUND: The main issue reported by user is a frontend display bug, not content generation failure. API calls are working correctly (GEMINI FLASH generates proper theological content, VERSETS PROG API returns 4750 characters), but VERSETS PROG has a UI rendering issue where generated content is not displayed properly - only shows loading text instead of actual content. GEMINI FLASH button works perfectly. The reported placeholder text was not found - content is real and substantial. PRIORITY: Fix VERSETS PROG content display logic in frontend."
