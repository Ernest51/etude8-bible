The trajectory documents a multi-faceted development and debugging process for an AI-powered Bible study application. The work began with implementing the user's request to add four, then five, control buttons (gemini, chatgpt, prise de note, api, Lire la Bible) to each of the 28 generated rubrique pages. This involved modifying  to include the buttons and their handlers, updating  to pass the necessary functions as props, and adding corresponding CSS in .

A significant portion of the work was dedicated to iterative debugging of a persistent mobile UI bug: a vertical bar appearing on the right side of the screen on iOS. After multiple failed attempts using CSS overrides, the root cause was identified as an inline style in  forcing a grid layout. The final fix involved removing the inline style and applying aggressive CSS overrides to enforce a single-column layout on mobile.

The engineer also implemented two major feature requests: a fully functional API monitoring modal within each rubrique page and a comprehensive Biblical Characters search feature in the . This second feature included a new UI with tabs, a filterable list of 70+ characters, and a detail view. This led to further debugging of JavaScript scope errors (), which were resolved by moving constants and functions to the correct component scope.

The final phase of the trajectory was dominated by a critical deployment issue. The user reported that the live Vercel site was not updating. The engineer diagnosed the problem as a lack of a configured git remote, complicated by the  and  directories being git submodules, which prevented successful commits and pushes. The work concluded with the AI engineer stuck in a loop, attempting various git commands to force a commit of the submodule contents, a task that remains unresolved.

<product_requirements>
The application is an AI-driven Bible study tool. The primary user requirement is to provide a rich, interactive, and resilient study experience.

**Core Feature Enhancements:**
- **Interactive Rubriques:** Each of the 28 generated study pages () must contain five functional control buttons: gemini, chatgpt, prise de note, Lire la Bible, and api.
- **API Monitoring:** The api button within each rubrique must open a detailed modal displaying the real-time status (with colored LEDs) of all available APIs (four Gemini keys and one Bible API fallback).
- **Expanded Concordance:** The Bible de Concordance page must be enhanced with a new, tabbed interface. One tab should provide the existing concordance search, while a new Personnages Bibliques tab should allow users to search a list of 70+ biblical figures and view their detailed, AI-generated histories.
- **AI-Powered Enrichment:** The concordance page must feature two distinct Gemini buttons—one for enriching theme-based searches and another for generating deeper insights on selected biblical characters.

**Technical & UI/UX Requirements:**
- **API Resilience:** The backend must support and automatically rotate through four separate Gemini API keys, ensuring high availability.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** The application must have a flawless mobile UI, specifically eliminating a persistent vertical bar on the right side of the screen on iOS and ensuring all new features like the character list are fully usable on small screens.
- **Deployment:** All completed local features must be successfully deployed and visible on the live Vercel production site.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React.js (Component Props, State Management with , Conditional Rendering).
- **Backend:** Python with FastAPI.
- **API Management:** A custom API key rotation and fallback system () to manage multiple Gemini keys and a Bible API.
- **UI/UX:** Advanced responsive CSS using Media Queries to fix platform-specific bugs (iOS) and adapt complex layouts for mobile.
- **Version Control:** Git, with a significant unresolved issue involving submodules that is preventing deployment.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with distinct frontend and backend directories, which are themselves git submodules.

- ****
  - **Importance**: Displays the content for a single generated study topic. It is the component where the user experience is most focused.
  - **Summary of Changes**: This file was heavily modified to include five new control buttons. It was refactored to accept multiple functions as props from  to make the buttons functional. A complete API status modal, replicating the logic from , was added directly into this component, managed by local state.

- ****
  - **Importance**: Provides the Bible concordance search tool.
  - **Summary of Changes**: This page underwent a major overhaul. It was transformed into a tabbed interface to house both the original concordance search and a new Biblical Characters search feature. A hardcoded list of 70+ characters was added, along with state management for searching and displaying character details. Two new Gemini buttons and their associated handler functions (, ) were also implemented. Several scope-related JavaScript bugs were fixed here.

- ****
  - **Importance**: The main application component, managing routing, state, and component composition.
  - **Summary of Changes**: Modified to pass down numerous handler functions (e.g., , ) as props to . A critical inline style forcing a two-column grid layout () was removed to fix a major mobile UI bug.

- ****
  - **Importance**: The global stylesheet for the application.
  - **Summary of Changes**: This file received numerous additions. Styles were created for the five new control buttons in . Most importantly, aggressive, responsive media queries were added to resolve the iOS vertical bar issue by forcing a single-column layout () on mobile devices. Further styles were added to make the new character list in the concordance responsive.

- ****
  - **Importance**: Stores environment variables and API keys for the backend.
  - **Summary of Changes**: This file was updated twice to include two new Gemini API keys, named  and , bringing the total number of rotating keys to four.

- ****
  - **Importance**: Manages the API key rotation logic.
  - **Summary of Changes**: The  list within this module was updated twice to incorporate the two new keys from the  file, expanding the rotation pool from two to four keys.

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix Dernière étude button**: The functionality for this button was mentioned as a pending task in the initial context but was not addressed during the development cycle.
- **Resolve Git Submodule Issue for Deployment**: The most critical pending task is to fix the version control problem that prevents committing and pushing the  and  submodule changes, which is blocking any updates to the Vercel production environment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was grappling with a critical deployment blocker. The user reported that none of the newly developed features were appearing on the live Vercel URL. The engineer correctly diagnosed that the local code was not being pushed to the remote GitHub repository.

Further investigation revealed two core issues:
1.  There was no  remote configured in the git repository.
2.  The  and  directories were structured as git submodules, which severely complicated the process of staging and committing changes from the root directory.

The engineer's last actions were a series of failing command-line attempts to resolve this. They tried to  the submodules, remove the submodule tracking (), and force-add the files. Every attempt failed, leaving the repository in a state where all the completed feature work is present locally but cannot be pushed to the remote repository for deployment. The current, unfinished task is to find a way to create a valid commit that includes all the recent changes across the entire codebase, bypassing or resolving the submodule conflict.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Resolve the git submodule issue by removing submodule tracking and creating a new, clean commit that includes all frontend and backend code, enabling the work to finally be pushed to the remote repository.
