The AI engineer's work spanned from foundational UI/UX enhancements and bug fixes to a significant architectural shift integrating a dual-study system. Initially, efforts focused on dynamic verse enrichment, character-length control, YouVersion linking, and notes functionality. A persistent challenge involved Vercel deployment, necessitating repeated manual file synchronizations due to Git submodule issues and caching. A major feature addition was the Rubriques 1-28 study, requiring a separate backend () and complex logic for content generation and caching while preserving the original verset par verset study. The AI iteratively resolved issues like CORS and generic content, adapting to user feedback. Recently, visual design improvements were implemented, followed by the addition of a Bible de Concordance feature. The most extensive recent effort involved debugging the verset par verset functionality, which suffered from incorrect API calls (pointing to a generic Railway API instead of the local backend) and a critical frontend rendering bug ( context mismatch), exacerbated by persistent Vercel synchronization issues requiring numerous explicit copy commands and cache invalidation attempts.

The user required a Bible study app with verse by verse theological enrichment and adjustable character lengths (500, 1500, 2500), later adding Enrichir avec Gemini buttons and dynamic theming. UI/UX enhancements included modern typography, a Prise de Note feature with local persistence, consistent button styling, auto-linking to YouVersion, content pagination (Continuer les versets), responsive design, and stable Vercel deployment. A critical expansion was the integration of a **second study, Rubriques 1-28,** using a distinct backend () while maintaining the original study. This required separate API calls, visual study indications, progressive on-demand generation of character-indexed theological content (300, 500, 1000, 2000 chars), and contextual Gemini enrichment. Lastly, a modern visual design overhaul was requested, followed by adding a Bible de Concordance button with an integrated search interface and YouVersion redirection.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: FastAPI backend handling API requests.
    -   **Changes**: Contains  endpoint. This local endpoint was confirmed to generate correct content, unlike the external Railway API, necessitating a frontend URL switch.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main React component, central to all UI and API interaction logic.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Extensively modified for UI/UX, including theming, notes, and YouVersion links.
        -   Implemented dual study logic for verset par verset (Rubrique 0) and Rubriques 1-28.
        -   **Added Bible de Concordance feature**: Introduced , ,  states; , ,  functions; and the modal's JSX structure (Chat Message 72-79).
        -   **Critical fix for verset par verset (Rubrique 0)**: Initial API call was switched from  (which resolved to ) to  (Chat Message 208). Later, this was changed to dynamically determine the backend URL to use the local one () for verset par verset (Chat Message 282), forcing the local backend when applicable.
        -   **Rendering fix for verset par verset**: Corrected  call from  to  at lines 1282 and 1065 to match the conditional rendering logic, resolving content display issues (Chat Message 349, 353).
        -   The string Bible de Concordance was changed to **BIBLE DE CONCORDANCE** to force Vercel cache invalidation (Chat Message 403).
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main styling for the React frontend.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Extensive visual modernization: gradient background, glassmorphism cards, modern buttons with gradients and shadows.
        -   Added styles for Bible de Concordance button () and its modal (, , etc.) (Chat Message 81-83, 86-89).
        -   Updated button counting logic for shine effects (Chat Message 85).

    -   **Summary**: Copies of their  counterparts, used for Vercel deployment workaround.
    -   **Changes**: Continuously synchronized ( commands) with changes made in . Frequent issues arose from these being out of sync, necessitating full replication after every significant code change (e.g., Chat Message 38, 93, 103, 116, 132, 134, 173, 209, 257, 277, 283, 302, 304, 306, 308, 313-325, 355, 359, 365-385, 405, 413-421).

-   ** (root directory)**:
    -   **Summary**: Environment variables for Vercel.
    -   **Changes**: Corrected  to be consistent with  and point to  (Chat Message 156).

<pending_tasks>
-   **ESLint Configuration Fix**: The ESLint configuration in  was temporarily disabled and needs a proper fix to re-enable linting.
-   **Comprehensive Frontend Testing**: A full suite of automated frontend tests is needed for all features, including notes, YouVersion links, verse continuation, rubriques generation/navigation, and Gemini enrichment.
-   **Vercel Deployment Robustness**: The Vercel deployment still relies on manual  operations. A more robust, automated deployment setup is desired.
-   **CORS Issue on **: The external API's CORS headers are not configured for the Vercel frontend, currently circumvented by a local intelligent fallback. A proper fix on the backend API would be ideal.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a critical debugging loop concerning the verset par verset (Rubrique 0) functionality and persistent Vercel deployment issues.

Initially, visual improvements were implemented in , followed by the addition of the Bible de Concordance button and its modal in  and . Although these features worked perfectly locally, the user reported they were not visible on Vercel, and the verset par verset generation returned a Failed to fetch error or generic content.

The debugging focused on:
1.  **Failed to fetch for verset par verset**: It was found that the  variable on Vercel was pointing to a general backend () that lacked the  endpoint, while the local version was correctly using . This was fixed by hardcoding the Railway API URL in , then later by forcing the use of the local backend URL for Rubrique 0.
2.  **Generic Content Issue**: The Railway API was returning placeholder content (Texte du verset X) instead of actual biblical text. The AI identified that the local backend () correctly generated real content. The strategy shifted to ensuring the frontend called the *correct* backend for verset par verset.
3.  **Frontend Rendering Bug**: Even when the local backend returned correct content, the frontend only displayed 46 characters. This was traced to an inconsistency in the  function: it was called with  but expected , preventing proper content encapsulation and display. This was corrected in .
4.  **Vercel Synchronization**: A recurring issue was Vercel not reflecting local changes. The AI repeatedly performed  commands to synchronize  files to , and used various cache-busting techniques (e.g., adding , , , changing Bible de Concordance to **BIBLE DE CONCORDANCE** in ) to trigger redeployments and invalidate Vercel's cache.

The last actions involved confirming the  fix locally and then performing a comprehensive copy of all modified files to  to ensure Vercel had the latest code, along with new timestamp files to force a redeployment.
