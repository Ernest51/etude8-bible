The trajectory outlines a comprehensive debugging and feature enhancement cycle for a Bible study application. The initial task was to fix a navigation bug where the VERSETS PROG button failed to open the dedicated study page. This led to a deep dive into the React component , involving extensive debugging with console logs, forced navigation attempts, and troubleshooting the event handler attachment, eventually revealing a file path confusion between  and .

Upon fixing the navigation, a new issue surfaced: Gemini API rate limiting. The user provided multiple API keys, prompting the engineer to architect a robust backend solution. This involved creating a new module, , to implement an intelligent cache, an automatic API key rotation system (cycling through two Gemini keys), and a final fallback to a Bible API to ensure service continuity.

Subsequent work focused on refining this new system. The user reported bugs related to the fallback mechanism, including placeholder text (Texte du verset...), repetitive theological explanations, and severe content duplication and ordering issues on the Verset par Verset page. These were traced to incorrect backend logic and, more significantly, faulty regex parsing in the  frontend component, which was fixed.

The final major task was to overhaul the 28 Rubriques feature, which was using generic placeholders. The engineer replaced an external API call with a new local endpoint () powered by the Gemini key rotation system and corrected the frontend parsing logic in  to handle the new API response format. A bug with the dernière étude button was also identified but not resolved.

<product_requirements>
The application is an AI-powered Bible study tool designed to provide deep theological analysis.

**Core Feature: Verset par Verset Study**
- A VERSETS PROG button must trigger a study of the selected book and chapter, navigating the user to a dedicated page.
- This page must display the biblical text and theological analysis in sequential batches of 5 verses (e.g., 1-5, 6-10).
- A Suivant (Next) button must correctly load the subsequent batch of verses without duplication, ordering errors, or placeholder text.

**API Resilience and Content Quality**
- The application must gracefully handle API rate limits. It needs to implement an automatic rotation system, first trying a primary Gemini key, then a secondary Gemini key, and finally falling back to a Bible API if both fail.
- The goal is to prevent study interruptions due to quota issues.
- When the Bible API fallback is used, it must display the *actual* biblical text, not generic placeholders or repetitive, templated explanations.

**Core Feature: 28 Rubriques Study**
- This feature must generate intelligent, unique theological content for each of the 28 study points using the internal Gemini API system.
- It must not display generic placeholder text like Le contenu de cette rubrique sera généré automatiquement....

**Additional Functionality**
- A Dernière étude (Last Study) button should allow users to save and restore their most recent study session. This feature must be functional.
- The user interface on the study page should be a clean, single-column layout.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React.js (,  for state management).
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI.
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for primary content generation.
- **API Resilience**: A custom-built backend system featuring intelligent caching, automatic rotation between multiple API keys, and a fallback mechanism to a separate Bible API.
- **Content Parsing**: Heavy reliance on Regular Expressions (Regex) in the React frontend to parse and structure the raw markdown content returned by the backend API into displayable components.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with distinct frontend and backend services. A key characteristic is the mirrored  directories for development and Vercel builds, requiring careful synchronization.



- ****
  - **Importance**: The main FastAPI application file defining all API endpoints.
  - **Summary of Changes**: It was significantly modified to integrate the new resilience logic. The primary endpoint  was refactored to call the . A new endpoint, , was created to power the 28 Rubriques feature locally, replacing a hardcoded external API.

- ****
  - **Importance**: This is a new, critical module created to handle all complex API interactions, ensuring the application remains functional despite API quota limits.
  - **Summary of Changes**: Created from scratch, this module implements:
    1.  An intelligent cache to store generated content.
    2.  Logic to manage and rotate between two Gemini API keys ( and ).
    3.  A fallback mechanism that calls a Bible API when both Gemini keys are exhausted.
    4.  Functions to correctly parse verse ranges (e.g., 6-10) and fetch authentic biblical text.
    5.  Fixed an  event loop conflict.

- ****
  - **Importance**: The root component of the React application, managing global state, routing, and rendering the main interface, including the 28 Rubriques feature.
  - **Summary of Changes**: This file was the focus of debugging the initial VERSETS PROG navigation issue. Later, it was modified to fix the 28 Rubriques feature by:
    1.  Changing the  call's URL from an external API to the new local  endpoint.
    2.  Correcting the  function with an updated regex () to correctly parse the new markdown format returned by the local Gemini API.
    3.  Logic for the non-functional Dernière étude button resides here.

- ****
  - **Importance**: The dedicated component for displaying the verse-by-verse study. It handles fetching paginated content, parsing it, and rendering it.
  - **Summary of Changes**: This file was heavily modified to fix severe display bugs. The  function's regex was updated to correctly handle markdown () and split the content, which resolved the critical issues of verse duplication and incorrect ordering during pagination. The erroneously added second Bienvenue column was also removed from this file's JSX.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix Dernière étude button**: The button for restoring the last study is non-functional. The logic for saving a study to localStorage ( function) is not being triggered correctly upon content generation, preventing any study from being saved and thus restored.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent task was to fix the 28 Rubriques feature, which was displaying generic placeholder text instead of AI-generated theological content.

The AI engineer successfully diagnosed that while the newly created backend endpoint () was functioning correctly and generating valid content with Gemini, the frontend was failing to display it. The root cause was identified in : the  function used an outdated regular expression () that did not match the markdown format () being returned by the new backend.

The final action taken was to update this regex in . The engineer then restarted the frontend service and was preparing to run a final validation test to confirm that the rich, AI-generated content for the 28 rubriques now correctly appears in the user interface.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Use the frontend testing agent to run a comprehensive test on the 28 Rubriques feature to confirm that the parsing fix is effective and the UI now correctly displays the AI-generated content for each rubrique.
